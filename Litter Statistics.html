            <p>Litter is everywhere around us: Floating in and clogging up rivers, spread amongst forest floors, everywhere. <br>Litter also comes in many different forms, and from many different sources. <br> Here, we'll discuss what kinds of objects make up the litter in our backyards, how they're effecting the environment, and what you can do to help.</p>

           <!--This creates an area where both text, and a card/image can exist side by side through flexbox.-->

                <h2>Plastic</h2>
                <p>As we may well know, plastic makes up the highest percentage of littered objects and materials, not just in Australia, but all over the world.</p>
                <p>Plastic pollution is one of the worst forms of pollution on the planet, and it's no different in Australia. Plastic makes up over 60% of all of Australia's litter waste, with over 75% of the country's coastal waste being made up of plastic.</p>
                <p>Plastic litter itself comes in many different forms, including cigarette butts, food wrappers, bottles and bottle caps, straws, and even takeout containers, with cigarette butts making up the highest percentage of littered plastics.</p>
                <p>But, why is it so deadly? <br> Depending on where the plastic is deposited, it could interfere with the local wildlife, as it's easy for animals to get caught in different containgers (nets, plastic bags, six-pack rings, etc). <br>There's also the concern with wildlife eating the plastic, as it's easy for plastics to get mixed up in or confused with the animals food. <br> This can lead to thousands, or even millions of animals dying from plastic pollution alone.</p>
                <p>What makes plastic pollution truly deadly is how it can break down over time. <br> Over hundreds of years, plastic break down into microplastics, which can make their way into oceans, or the bush. <br>This makes it easy for plastics to enter the food chain unnoticed, being eaten by herbivores that graze on plants, and then working its way up in the food chain.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Australians used more than 3.5 million tons of plastic in 2022</li>
                        <!--List items.-->
                        <li>84% of Australia's annual plastic consumption is sent to landfill, and 16% is recycled.</li>
                        <li>130,000 tons of plastic finds its way into the ocean per year.</li>
                        <li>Our use of plastic will double by 2040</li>

                <h2>Metal</h2>
                <p>We've all seen it, metalic drink cans that've been trashed and thrown on the side of the road, abandoned cars in the middle of god knows where, sheets of metal laying around, broken computers, etc.</p>
                <p>Metal litter is one of the most common materials of litter next to plastic, and can come in many different forms as stated above. Unlike plastic, metal litter is much easier to see, but that doesn't make it any less dangerous.</p>
                <p>Larger metalic objects, such as broken down cars, fridges, heaters, oil drums, etc. can leak toxic chemicals into the environment, chemicals that aren't meant to be there. <br>Things like oil, paint, rust, coolants, and battery acid can easily leak into our back yard, and if we're not careful, that can pose more than just danger to the animals.</p>
                <p>Larger metal litter with toxic chemicals have been reported to combust, causing many of Australia's wildfires in the hotter seasons.</p>
                <p>Smaller metal litter however can remain unseen, and can very easily be walked on by wildlife, or even passerby's. If left unattended, this can lead to a high risk of infection.</p>
                <p>It's not all doom and gloom though, much of the metal we use up is recycled, having a higher recycling rate than other materials we use, and we're continuing to get better with our recycling efforts, increasing by 57% in the last 15 years.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Australia produces over 350,000 aluminium cans every minute.</li>
                        <li>In 2015-2016, Australia recycled over 90,000 tons of aluminium and steel cans.</li>
                        <li>Batteries, as common as they are, are often the culprit of fires, even starting them in garbage trcks and waste facilities.</li>
                        <li>Electronic litter and rubbish is growing 3 times faster than other litter materials.</li>
                        <li>Up to 98% of computer and TV components can be recycled, though less than 1% of TVs and computers are actually recycled.</li>
