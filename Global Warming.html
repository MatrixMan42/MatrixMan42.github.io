                <h1>A hotter Australia</h1>
                <p>Climate change has been a devestating movement around the world for hundreds of years now, and that's no less true here in the outback. <br>Ever since 1910, Australia has been observing the effects of global warming on its climate, and over time, despite many efforts to reverse it, the situation's only gotten worse. On top of that, the situation is predicted to keep getting worse for many decades to come.</p>

                <p>But how exactly has climate change gotten so bad? And what kind of effects has it had on the environment? That's what we're here to inform you about!<br>This page will go cover the effects of Climate change, what we as a civilisation have done to produce Global warming, and how we as a community can help stop it!</p>

            <h2>Changing the climate</h2>
            <p>When people here the phrase 'Climate Change', most tend to think of it as the environment getting hotter, and relating specifically to Global Warming. While that's partly true, it's more to do with the after effects of the planet warming up.</p>
            <p>Climate change covers a whole variety of phenomena that are effecting the planet, in this case, Australia. <br>This ranges from how Global warming's effecting Australia's forests and bushlands, how it's effecting Australia's fauna, the sea levels and how they're devastating Australia's coastlines, and how it all comes back around and effects us.</p>

            <h3>What's the cause?</h3>
            <p>there're many ways that climate change is caused, specifically here in Australia. Here's a rundown on some of the ways climate change is caused.</p>

            <div class="Listy">
                <ul>
                    <li>Burning Fossil fuels: Probably the biggest contributing factor to global warming and climate change, fossil fuels. <br> This has mostly been done by factories and other industrial complexes that release large amounts of C02 into the atmosphere that's produced when creating products and raw materials. <br>Although Fossil Fuels can also be burnt through other means, like transportation (Cars, trucks, planes, etc.), and even in our every day household appliances (Fridges, heaters, ovens, etc.). <br>This can also create a toxic feedback loop. As Australia's a hot country, many Australians resort to using air conditioning in the summer. This sends C02 into the atmosphere and heats up the environment, encouraging more people to use their air conditioning.</li>
                    <li>Deforestation: Many of the goods and services we use such as paper, plastics, toothpaste, shampoo, and paint comes from trees. However, we have to cut the trees down in order to be able to process them into those very products. <br>Not only do the fossil fuels burnt powering logging equipment contribute to global warming, but by cutting down trees, we're getting rid of the very things that are able to soak up excess C02 from the atmosphere. Trees also produce high amounts of Methane when cut down, further adding to the problem.</li>

                    <li>Forest Fires: Being a naturally hot country, we're highly prone to forest fires. In fact, there are a reported 45,000 - 60,000 forest fires each year in Australia alone. <br>Forest Fires burn up and destroy large sections of bushland, getting rid of C02 sponges and sending huge amounts of C02 and methane into the atmosphere, and killing precious wildlife. <br>Again this is a toxic cycle, as forest fires result in a hotter climate, which just encourages more forest fires to start!</li>
                    <li>Farming and agriculture: Believe it or not, but even the good natured act of farming can be hazardous to the environment. Livestock, such as horses and cows, produce huge amounts of methane, and while this isn't usually that harmful to the environment, Australia is 55% farmland, so the sheer scale of it is ramped up to dangerous amounts.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="Liner">
                <h3>What's the effect?</h3>
                <p>Climate change and global warming has had some seriously nasty effects on Australia's eco-system, the wildlife, and the environment. <br>Here's just a few ways the environment's been negatively impacted due to global warming.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Listy">
                <ul>
                    <li>Rising temperature: Australia's average temperature has increased by about 1.4C since 1910. Since 1950 especially, each decade's gotten a little warmer than the last one. It may not sound like much, but even an increase of a single degree can cause havoc on the environment. <br>While this is an Earth-wide issue, Australia is a big contributor to Greenhouse gasses compared to other countries in the world.</li>
                    <li>Sea levels: Over the last 100 years, the sea level has risen by approximately 17 centimeters. This hasn't had any major impact yet, although sea levels are continuing to raise at an increased level. And, if they continue this trend, the sea level could engulf coastlines, causing major damage to most coastal cities. <br>The increase in water level is caused by the arctic poles melting, flooding fresh water into the salt water. <br>This can have huge detrimental effects on our ecy-system, wiping out entire species, changing ocean currents, and affecting other major weather patterns.</li>
                    <li>Polluted Rivers and waterways: It can and should also be noted that the runoff from industrial complexes, factories and mining operations can produce an array of toxic substances that can pollute our beaches, rivers and waterways. <br>This makes them far less suitable for life, wiping out small ecosystems that used to call them home.</li>
                    <li>The Bushland: As stated earlier, the rising temperatures can encourage forest and bush fires that wipe out huge sections of plantlife. <br>But even without forest fires, the rising temperature can interfere with different kinds of animals, effecting their breeding cycles, their migration, their diets, and it can impair their ability to function. <br>The rising temperature and addage of toxic chemicals in the atmosphere can also result in many plants going extinct, slowly but surely killing off local forests.</li>
